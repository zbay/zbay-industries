        <h3>About "Us"</h3>
        <p>Zbay Industries is not a real company. At least, not yet. It's an ironic name for the modest and heretofore unprofitable career of 
        Zachary Williams.</p>
        <h3>About the CEO</h3>
        <p>I, Zachary Williams, am an aspiring web developer. I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill in December with a worthless liberal arts degree. 
        I thought I wanted to be a lawyer until about a year ago,
        when I realized the error of my ways and decided to learn how to code. 
        Using free and cheap resources, including <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.com</a>, I taught myself 
        a full JavaScript stack. A committed and successful autodidact, 
        I am now positive that I can help almost any company in need of a JavaScript developer.</p>
        <h3>Specialties</h3>
        <p>I am confident in the following languages or technologies:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Client-side JavaScript, including the jQuery library</li>
        <li>Server-side JavaScript, with Node and Express</li>
        <li>React.js and related tools (React Router, ES5 transpilers, bundlers, the Flux pattern and Redux in particular)</li>
        <li>MongoDB</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        I have some experience with the following languages/technologies:
        <ul>
        <li>MySQL and PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>D3.js</li>
        <li>AngularJS 1</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        I intend to learn the following technologies in the future, in approximate order of priority:
        <ul>
        <li>AngularJS 2</li>
        <li>Java (in greater depth) and Spark</li>
        <li>React Native and mobile app development</li>
        <li>Ruby and Ruby on Rails</li>
        <li>Flask</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        </div>
        );
    }
});
